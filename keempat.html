<h1 style="text-align:center;"style="font-family:courier;">Family Events</h1>
<p>We always do many activities because for us it is very important. Of course, the activities are common but it is meaningful when you do it with someone precious to you.</p>
<p>RAMADAN KAREEM
Normally, my family will have the 'sahur and buka puasa' together.</p>
<p>EID MUBARAK
Eid always be the most awaited events for the most of Muslims in the world. Hence, we also celebrate it happily</p>
<p>BIRTHDAY
My parents always buy the cake and special treats such as buying favorite food during our birthday.</p>
<p>VISITING OUR GRANDPARENTS
We often go to our grandparents house during weekend. For me, it is very exciting to see them live in a good health. In addition, I could meet my cousins there.</p>
<p>TRAVEL 
Most recently, my family and I went to Penang. It will be great if we can travel again next time</p>
